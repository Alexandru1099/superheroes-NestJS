A simple app NestJS API that manages superheroes.

## Installation

## Collaboration
- Keep an open communication line
- suggest refactors, and discuss potential optimizations or new features.

## If I Had More Time
- Implement a complete authentication system (JWT with refresh tokens).
- Add a role-based authorization system (admin / user) with restricted endpoints.
- Refactor the in-memory (or MongoDB) storage to an SQL-based solution (e.g., PostgreSQL) for more robust relational data management.
